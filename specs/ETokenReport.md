## Contract Description


### Bugs Found and Recommendations

### Assumptions Made


### Important State Variables



### Invariants

<list your invariants here>
1. (![timeout]) `[timing_out_invariant]`:
	example of timing out invariant
2. (![failing]) `[failing_invariant]`:
	example of invariant failing
3. (![exception]) `[exception_invariant]`:
	example of invariant failing due to exception
4. (![passing]) `[passing_invariant]`:
	example of invariant passing
5. (![TODO]) `[todo_invariant]`:
	example of invariant TODO

### State Evolution

<list your rules here>

7. (![TODO]) Deposit:
    7.1 (![TODO]) `[deposit_increasing]`: depositing only increases EToken balance
    7.2 (![TODO]) `[deposit_contained]`: depositing has no affect on other assets
    7.3 (![TODO]) `[deposit_accurate]` : correct amount is always added to the balance

8. (![TODO]) Withdraw:
    8.1 (![TODO]) `[withdraw_decreasing]`: withdrawing only decreases EToken balance
    8.2 (![TODO]) `[withdraw_contained]`: withdrawing does not affect other assets
    8.3 (![TODO]) `[withdraw_accurate]`: correct amount is always subtracted from the balance
